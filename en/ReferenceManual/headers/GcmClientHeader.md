-------------------------

## Introduction

AppSteroid GcmClient API can be used to receive GCM Notifications of events such as incoming text messages, new forum messages, and many more.

The [AppSteroid.start()](AndroidSDK.md#com_fresvii_AppSteroid_void_start_Context_String_String_String_String) method will automatically start the GcmClient any time the user logs in.
So in most cases, you won't have to worry about working with the GcmClient class, unless you wish to perform a specific task, such as registering a GCM NotificationListener.
Just continue reading the document on [Receiving GCM Notifications](../GetStarted/GcmNotifications.md) instead.

## Introduction

AppSteroid Group API can be used to manage AppSteroid groups. You can create groups, add or remove members to/from groups, etc. Groups are the cornerstone for many AppSteroid features. E.g. [Group Chat](GroupChat.md), [VoiceChat](VoiceChat.md) and [Matchmaking](Matchmaking.md) Feature are closely tied to groups. Group creation and management is one of the major tasks your application will have to handle to make full use of these features.
